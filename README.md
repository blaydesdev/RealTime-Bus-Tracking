# RealTime Bus Tracking
 MIT xPRO: RealTime Bus Tracking Exercise

Project Description:

In this project we take data from the MBTA about Route 1, that runs between MIT and Harvard, and track all of the busses currently active on that route. This one was fun and challenging to put together, and in the end it allowed me to follow the busses as they headed through the route.


How to Run:

You can fork this repository or download the files to your local machine, and all you need to do then is load index.html in your preferred browser.


Future Improvements:

When putting this project together, I made a note that I wanted to give more information from the JSON file to each marker that could optionally be viewed if the user wanted.
